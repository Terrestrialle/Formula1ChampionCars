                Formula 1, also known as F1, is the premier category of international single-seater open-wheel racing, overseen by the 
                Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It has been in operation since its first race at the 1950 British Grand Prix.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term "formula" refers to the set of guidelines all participants' vehicles must adhere to. A Formula One season comprises 
                multiple races known as Grands Prix, which are held across various countries and continents on dedicated tracks or closed public roads.
            </p>
            <p>
                Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing vehicles globally, achieving high cornering speeds through significant 
                aerodynamic downforce. The cars evolve annually under specific regulations, producing some of the most iconic racing machines.

            <p>
                Formula One evolved from the European Motor Racing Championships of the 1920s and 1930s. Prior to the official establishment of the 
                Formula 1 World Championship in 1950, motor racing, including Grand Prix events, was flourishing in Europe. The Formula One 
                regulations were agreed upon in 1946 and took effect in 1947.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early 1900s, motor racing gained traction across Europe, particularly in countries like France, Italy, and Germany. Grand Prix races, 
                initially organized by automotive clubs, showcased leading manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz, Auto Union, Bugatti, and Alfa Romeo. The 1920s 
                saw the rise of significant Grand Prix events, such as the French and Italian Grand Prix, drawing large audiences and global interest.

            <p>
                Cars from this era were generally large and heavy, often equipped with superchargers for increased power. The 1930s marked the Golden Age of 
                Grand Prix racing, with notable events like the Monaco, German, and Belgian Grand Prix becoming prominent. The European Grand Prix, rotating 
                between different circuits, was a flagship event. Legendary drivers like Tazio Nuvolari, Rudolf Caracciola, and Achille Varzi became famous, 
                showcasing remarkable skill and bravery. This period also saw technological innovations like independent suspension systems and streamlined 
                bodywork to enhance performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Safety standards were low, with races held on demanding road circuits, posing significant risks to drivers and spectators. Sadly, many drivers 
                from this era lost their lives in crashes. World War II halted Grand Prix racing in 1939, as resources were redirected to the war effort. Many 
                circuits were repurposed for military use, and several key drivers and manufacturers were involved in the conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Grand Prix under the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, preceding the formula's official start. Before WWII, proposals 
                were made for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but the war delayed its implementation. The new International Formula 
                was formalized in 1946, effective from 1947, and the World Championship began in 1950.

            <p>
                Alfa Romeo and Ferrari were dominant forces in the early years, with powerful engines and skilled drivers. From 1950 to 1959, Alfa Romeo, 
                Ferrari, and Maserati together won 7 Drivers' World Championships and led for 6 seasons, before Mercedes-Benz and British manufacturers 
                like Vanwall and Cooper claimed the remaining titles of the decade.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 1950s saw rapid technological progress, including advanced chassis designs, aerodynamic improvements, and more powerful engines. 
                Supercharged engines were common early on, gradually being replaced by naturally aspirated engines. The 1958 season introduced the 
                Constructors' Championship, acknowledging the manufacturers' contributions. Vanwall became the first team to win the Constructors' 
                Championship in 1958 with the Vanwall VW5, though the Drivers' Championship went to Mike Hawthorn in the Ferrari 246 F1. The decade 
                ended with Jack Brabham winning his first World Championship in 1959 with the Cooper team.

            <p>
                The 1960s was a transformative decade for Formula 1, featuring technological advancements, new teams and drivers, and significant regulatory 
                changes. The decade started with the widespread adoption of rear-engine cars, a trend started by Cooper in 1959, helping Jack Brabham win 
                his first title that year. By 1960, this layout became the norm due to its better weight distribution and handling. British teams like 
                Lotus, BRM, and Cooper dominated the early 1960s.

            <p>
                Drivers such as Jim Clark, Graham Hill, Jack Brabham, Jackie Stewart and John Surtees became leading figures in this era. Lotus, led by Colin Chapman, 
                introduced the monocoque chassis design with the Lotus 25 in 1962, significantly enhancing the car's rigidity and safety and setting a new 
                standard for Formula 1 car design. Honda entered Formula 1 in the mid-1960s, bringing its expertise in engine technology from motorcycle racing.
                The Honda RA272, driven by Richie Ginther, secured the company's first Grand Prix victory in 1965 at the Mexican Grand Prix.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teams began experimenting with aerodynamic elements, including wings and spoilers, to improve downforce and handling. In those 
                years its quite often seeing a team with ridiculously high spoiler. These innovations laid the groundwork for the sophisticated 
                aerodynamics seen in modern Formula 1 cars. However, in this era is considered one of the deadliest era of Formula 1 
                after 1950s era. The car is getting faster and more powerful but the safety standard is low both in car 
                and in track with minimal run off area and high kerbing. One of the most tragic 
                moment is the tragic loss of Jim Clark on 1968 Hockenheim Grand Prix during Formula 2 session in rain. Another notable crash is 
                when Jackie Stewart crash at Belgium Grand Prix of Spa-Franchorchamp in 1966 also in rain condition which resulting 
                him crash to telephone pole at approximately 165mph (266km/h) that shed his car, fortunately he survived those horiffic accident.
                These tragedies led to increased scrutiny of track safety and the introduction of regulations aimed at protecting drivers.

                The late 1960s saw the beginning of commercial sponsorship in Formula 1, with cars starting to feature 
                advertising logos. This change significantly increased the financial resources available to teams, 
                transforming the business model of the sport. The 1960s were a pivotal decade in Formula 1 history, characterized by 
                significant technological advancements, the rise of new teams and drivers, 
                and a growing awareness of safety issues. The innovations and changes during this period set the stage for

                The 1970s were a pivotal decade in Formula 1, marked by technological advancements, 
                increased commercial involvement, and the emergence of 
                new safety measures. Aerodynamics began to play a crucial role, with teams introducing wings and other aerodynamic devices to enhance 
                downforce and improve cornering speeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lotus, under the guidance of Colin Chapman, was a pioneer in aerodynamic 
                innovation. The Lotus 72, introduced in 1970, featured an 
                innovative wedge-shaped design and side-mounted radiators, becoming one of the most 
                successful cars of the decade.

            <p>
                Safety also became a significant focus following a series of fatal accidents. 
                Drivers such as Jochen Rindt, who posthumously won the 1970 
                championship, Roger Williamson, and Francois Cevert who tragically died in 1973, 
                highlighted the need for improved safety standards. The Grand Prix 
                Drivers' Association (GPDA) pushed for safer circuits, better medical facilities, 
                and stronger car construction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The decade saw fierce competition between teams like Ferrari, McLaren, and Tyrrell. 
                Niki Lauda, driving for Ferrari, became a dominant force, 
                winning the World Championship in 1975 and 1977. His near-fatal crash in 1976 and miraculous recovery to challenge for the title 
                highlighted the sport's dangers and the bravery of its drivers.

                Sponsorship and commercialism began to reshape Formula 1 in the 1970s. 
                Teams secured lucrative deals with major corporations, leading to 
                the now-familiar sight of cars adorned with prominent brand logos. Bernie Ecclestone, 
                who took control of the commercial rights for the 
                sport, played a crucial role in transforming Formula 1 into a global spectacle.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those era, many team use a legendary engine of Ford Cosworth DFV that proven reliable, powerful, has greatest 
                drivability and cheap. It's considered as one of the best engine ever used in Formula 1. 
                It produced around 500HP naturally aspirated which is a lot for those era.
            </p>
            <p>
                Towards the end of the decade, ground effect aerodynamics, pioneered by Lotus with the Lotus 79, 
                revolutionized car design. This innovation used shaped underbodies to create significant

            <p>
                The 1980s in Formula 1 were defined by the rise of turbocharged engines. Renault 
                pioneered this technology, and by mid-decade, most teams had adopted turbo engines, 
                leading to unprecedented power outputs and higher speeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those era is quite often formula 1 car got huge turbo lag because the turbo they are used is so big. 
                In the peak turbo era, in qualifying trim Formula 1 car could reach horsepower up to 1200HP that only lasted for 3 laps. In 1986, Benetton B186 got BMW engine 
                named M12/M13 that could produce 1400HP with over 5 Bar of turbo boost.

                The tragic deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix 
                led to significant safety improvements. The FIA introduced stricter regulations on car design, 
                circuit safety, and driver protection. It considered as one of the darkest day of Formula 1 after a long year 
                of no fatality in those era.

                The 2000s were marked by Ferrari's dominance, with Michael Schumacher winning five consecutive drivers' 
                titles from 2000 to 2004. The Ferrari F2002 and F2004 were particularly dominant, 
                showcasing the team's technical superiority and Schumacher's skill. With V10 engine era that become the most

                The early 2000s also saw the continuation of the rivalry between Ferrari and McLaren in the likes of Michael Schumacher 
                and Mika Hakkinen in year 2000. Teams like Williams, McLaren and Renault constantly giving Ferrari the competition throughout 
                the 2000 to 2004 before eventualy Ferrari dominance broke by Renault led by Fernando Alonso by 
                winning the drivers' and constructors' championships in 2005 and 2006.

                The decade witnessed significant changes in regulations aimed at improving safety and 
                reducing costs. The introduction of V10 and later V8 engines, along with aerodynamic 
                restrictions and banning of traction control, aimed to curb increasing speeds and make the 
                sport more competitive than before.

                The 2010s also saw increased efforts to improve safety, with the introduction of the halo device following 
                the tragic demise of Jules Bianchi at 2014 Japanese Grand Prix. Halo device introduced in 2018 to protect drivers' heads from debris and impacts. The decade was characterized by 
                fierce competition, advanced technology, and a push towards more sustainable racing.

                The new technical regulations introduced in 2022 aimed to reduce aerodynamic 
                turbulence and promote closer racing. These changes saw a return to ground-effect
